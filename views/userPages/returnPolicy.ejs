          This Return Policy outlines how VENICARA (“we”, “us”, or “our”) handles returns and refunds for perfumes purchased through our website (the “Site”).  
          By purchasing our perfumes or using our services, you agree to the terms outlined in this Return Policy. If you do not agree, please do not proceed with your purchase.

      <!-- Changes Section -->
      <section class="mb-4">
        <h4 class="fw-semibold">Changes to This Return Policy</h4>
        <p>
          We may update this Return Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices, products, or for legal and regulatory reasons. When changes are made, we will post the updated policy on the Site and revise the “Last Updated” date.

      <!-- Eligibility Section -->
      <section class="mb-4">
        <h4 class="fw-semibold">Eligibility for Returns</h4>
        <p>
          At VENICARA, we aim to ensure your satisfaction with our perfumes. Returns are accepted within 7 days from the date of delivery for issues such as damaged packaging, defective products, or incorrect items delivered, in line with policies similar to Flipkart, Amazon, Ajio, and Myntra.
        </p>
        <p>
          Returns can be initiated for an entire order or specific perfume products. You must provide a valid reason for the return (e.g., "Damaged bottle," "Incorrect fragrance," "Leaking product") through your account dashboard or by contacting customer support.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Perfumes must be unused, with original packaging, seals, and labels intact. Opened or partially used perfumes are not eligible for return unless defective.</li>
          <li>Proof of purchase (order ID or invoice) is required.</li>
          <li>Non-returnable items include tester perfumes, gift sets with opened components, or products marked as non-returnable at the time of purchase.</li>
          <li>Returned perfumes are subject to inspection. If they do not meet our criteria, they may be returned to you at your expense.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Process Section -->
      <section class="mb-4">
        <h4 class="fw-semibold">How to Initiate a Return</h4>
        <p>Follow these steps to return a perfume:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Log in to your VENICARA account and go to "My Orders."</li>
          <li>Select the order or specific perfume you wish to return.</li>
          <li>Choose a return reason from the provided options and submit your request.</li>
          <li>Our admin team will review and approve your return request within 2-3 business days.</li>
          <li>Once approved, pack the perfume securely in its original packaging and ship it back using the provided return label or instructions (self-ship in certain cases).</li>
          <li>Upon receipt and inspection, we will process your refund.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Return shipping is free for eligible returns (e.g., due to our error, such as incorrect or damaged products). For other cases, you may need to bear the shipping cost.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Refund Section -->
      <section class="mb-4">
        <h4 class="fw-semibold">Refunds</h4>
        <p>
          Refunds will be processed within 5-7 business days after we receive and inspect the returned perfume. The refund will be credited to your VENICARA user wallet for future purchases. If you prefer a refund to your original payment method, please specify during the return request (subject to approval).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If a coupon or discount was applied, the refund amount will be adjusted by deducting the proportional coupon value from the returned perfume’s price.</li>
          <li>Original shipping charges (if any) are non-refundable unless the return is due to our error.</li>
          <li>For cash on delivery (COD) orders, refunds will be issued to your wallet or bank account, based on your preference.</li>
          <li>We reserve the right to deny refunds for fraudulent or abusive return requests.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Admin Approval Section -->
      <section class="mb-4">
        <h4 class="fw-semibold">Admin Approval and Exceptions</h4>
        <p>
          All return requests require approval from our admin team to ensure compliance with this policy. We may request additional information, such as photos of the product or packaging, to verify the return reason (e.g., damaged bottle or incorrect fragrance).
        </p>
        <p>
          Perfumes are delicate products, and returns for reasons like “dislike of fragrance” are not accepted unless explicitly stated at the time of purchase. Please review product descriptions and tester options (if available) before ordering.
        </p>
